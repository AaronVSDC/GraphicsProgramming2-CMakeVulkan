#Vulkan Renderer
##This project was part of my "Graphics Programming 2" course in "Digital Arts and Entertainment". We made a 3D renderer using the Vulkan API. My project supports the following Vulkan specific techniques or concepts: 
-Images and Buffers, including texture loading
-Depth Buffering
-Interactive camera with frame independant controls
-Deferred Rendering with Depth Prepass
-Physically Based Lighting using Image Based Lighting with HDR images, Cook-Torrance BRDF materials (using textures), Point Light, Directional Light
-Post Processing chain with Tone Mapping
